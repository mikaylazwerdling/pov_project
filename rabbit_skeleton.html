          The common rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, is a species of rabbit native to southwestern Europe and northwest Africa. It has become a very widespread species, and is considered an invasive one- especially in Australia, due to the lack of natural predators there. When not feeding (above ground), the common rabbit can be found in underground burrows called warrens. Members of this species are born altricial (blind, hairless, and completely dependent), one major difference between them and the related, precocial hares. O. cuniculus can reach between 13 and 20 inches in length, not including a tail thatâ€™s between 1.6 and 3.1 inches, and weigh between 2.4 and 5.5 pounds. As with others within the order Lagomorpha, the common rabbit has four sharp incisors that grow continuously throughout its lifetime. It locomotes by hopping, using its long and powerful hind legs. Its hind feet have a thick padding of fur, which dampens any shock from rapid hopping, and long, webbed toes that assist with balance as the animal hops.
          <br> <br>This genuine O. cuniculus skeleton is finely articulated and mounted onto a polished compressed-wood base. A clear dome on top completes the casing; this specimen makes for a lovely display.
